## Overview

## Technical Components

### Machine Learning Model

### Dynamic Website

We built a dynamic website using Flask that allows users to see housing data visualizations for the ten largest cities in the U.S. and get price predictions for their own home. On the home page is a map of the U.S. where the user can click on their desired city. This takes them to a page with geographic visualization of the housing data using plotly. The user can also customize the visualization by applying filters and submitting the form on the bottom of the page.

In the Data Collection & Prediction page, the user can enter the data for their own home to receive a price prediction generated by a machine learning model. Then, in the Data Visualization page, we used plotly to create graphs to visualize the data distribution for the current city. The user can also see where their own data lies alongside other homes in the same city. In the View Data page, The user can also view the raw data we collected.

The following is a function that renders the template for data collection that supports `GET` and `POST` methods. This is also where we use the model to make price predictions.

```{python}
def data_collection():

    if request.method == 'GET':
        city = request.args.get('city')
        return render_template('data_collection.html', city=city,
                               prediction = False)
    else:
        city = request.args.get('city')
        bed=request.form["bed"]
        session['bed_info'] = bed
        bath=request.form["bath"]
        session['bath_info'] = bath
        sqft=request.form["sqft"]
        session['sqft_info'] = sqft
        year_made=request.form["year_made"]
        home_type = request.form['home_type']
        zipcode = str(request.form["zipcode"])
        
        with open('Model/model1.pkl', 'rb') as f:
            model = pickle.load(f)
        
        price = model.predict(pd.DataFrame({
            'address/zipcode': [zipcode],
            'bathrooms': [bed],
            'bedrooms': [bath]
        }))

        return render_template('data_collection.html', city = city,
                               prediction = True,
                               price = int(price[0]),
                               bed=bed, bath=bath, sqft=sqft,
                               year_made=year_made,
                               home_type=home_type,
                               zipcode=zipcode)

```


### Complex Data Visualizations

## Conclusion

We hope for this website to be useful for people looking to sell their house or exploring housing in the ten largest cities in the U.S. However, we must also consider the possible ethical ramifications of this project. Having all the data accessible in easy to understand visualizataions could make it easy for companies or the wealthy to buy up cheap housing. This could end up displacing the current inabitants and lead to gentrification.
